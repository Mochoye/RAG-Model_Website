- **Query Interface**: Easily query your uploaded documents from a dedicated query page.
- **Built with LangChain**: Uses LangChain for seamless integration of retrieval-augmented generation.
- **API Integration**: Supports integration with OpenAI API for enhanced query capabilities.

   Start the application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Upload PDFs**:

   - Open your browser and navigate to the upload page.
   - Use the interface to upload the PDF files you wish to query.
   - If the upload process seems slow or gets stuck, restart the server by pressing `CTRL + C` in the terminal and running `python app.py` again.

3. **Query PDFs**:

   - After uploading, navigate to the query page.
   - Enter your query, and the app will use the RAG model to fetch relevant information from your documents.
   - Results will display in the interface, allowing for quick and effective document search.

## Troubleshooting

- **App Stuck on Upload/Query**: Restart the server with `CTRL + C` and rerun `python app.py`.
- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your API key is set correctly. Run `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key"` if needed.
